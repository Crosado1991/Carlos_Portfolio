            <p>
                I am a mostly self-taught software developer passionate about learning and growth. I have completed comprehensive courses on Udemy and freeCodeCamp where I have learned programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS.
                Practicing on platforms such as LeetCode and GitHub has honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, which has provided me with a 
                strong foundation of theoretical knowledge alongside real-world experience. I have a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals, and my self-directed learning journey has equipped me with the agility and adaptability needed to thrive in 
                dynamic tech environments. I am driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to contribute to cutting-edge projects. I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded professionals and expand my skill set.
